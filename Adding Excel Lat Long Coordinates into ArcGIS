Briefly:
1. Convert degrees/minutes/seconds to decimal degrees
2. Ensure data frame is set to WGS 1984
3. Add Excel table to ArcMap
4. Display XY Data
5. Save as feature class



######Convert degrees/minutes/seconds to decimal degrees
Check the ArcGIS/Basic to Convert degrees/minutes/seconds to decimal degrees

########Ensure data frame is set to your geographic coordinate system
In ArcGIS, right-click the “Layers” data frame in the table of contents. Then, select properties for the data frame.
In the coordinate system tab, expand geographic coordinate systems. Because GPS receivers use WGS84, click world and then select WGS 1984.
Now, the data frame is set to ****WGS 1984****** geographic coordinate system.

########Add Excel lat long coordinates table to ArcMap
Now, add your excel data to ArcMap (file > add data).
Navigate to your Excel spreadsheet and double-click the sheet with the lat long coordinates.
This will add the Excel table to ArcGIS and appear in the table of contents.

########Display XY Data
Right click the table and select display XY data.
    The X = longitude.
    The Y = latitude.
When you click OK, this will create an event layer in your map. But this is just a temporary layer that you need to make permanent.

########Save as feature class
As mentioned above, when you create an XY event layer, ArcGIS doesn’t save it to memory. Before you close your ArcGIS session, you need to create a feature class or shapefile.
So right-click the event layer and export data (data > export data). Next, click “use the same coordinate system as the data layer”.
Save the file. At this point, you permanently create a spatial file from an Excel spreadsheet.
