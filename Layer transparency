Tip:
For layers using a single symbol or for layers displayed by category, you can set the transparency of individual features using field values to set percent transparency.
You can set transparency for group layers. In these cases, it will take into account the transparency settings of each sublayer in the overall group layer transparency.
Layer transparency is applied to all features in the layer with each transparent object knocking out previously drawn transparent features in the same layer. Therefore, transparent features in the same layer will not blend with each other.
